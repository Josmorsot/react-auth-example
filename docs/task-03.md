# Task 03 - Pull Request review: showing correct dates

> [!NOTE]
> This part will make you take the role of a reviewer in a made-up pull-request. We want to see how you review code from others as well getting a feeling of your balance between constructive feedback and code-ownership.

Our team recently received a bug request regarding the dates shown in the matches table. Looks like the times are not being displayed correctly for some Clubs in the US. A junior team-mate already did the analysis, found the root cause of the problem, and prepared a fix. You need to review it before it can be merged into the release pipeline.

First you need to create this "demo" Pull Request. You can do that by manually running the **Open Test Pull Request** workflow from the **Actions** tab on your repo.

**Dos and Don'ts**
- You **must** leave a review stating if you would ‚úÖ **Approve**; üí¨ **Comment** ;or ‚ùå **Request changes**.
- You **should** leave a review in the code's PR itself if you find it necessary.
- You **shouldn't** make changes in code itself.
